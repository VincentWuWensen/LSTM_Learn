# LSTM_Learn
Just some records of learning the LSTM, it contains some sectiosn by AI modifications. The code integrates a number of technologies, including attention, CNN and KAN etc. Although this goes against the principle of Occam's Razor which make the prediction result not so well, but LSTM do learns the trend of future. By the way, how to solve the infomation leakage is still a preblem.
